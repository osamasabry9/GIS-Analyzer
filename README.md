
# GIS Analyzer


**GIS Analyzer** is a cutting-edge, client-only Geographic Information System (GIS) web application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. It empowers users to upload, visualize, draw, and perform sophisticated spatial analysis on geospatial data‚Äîall directly in the browser without any backend server.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Upload:** Support for GeoJSON and zipped Shapefiles, enabling seamless import of custom spatial datasets.
- **Interactive Drawing:** Tools for creating points, lines, polygons, rectangles, and measurements using **Mapbox GL Draw**.
- **Advanced Spatial Analysis:** Powered by **Turf.js** and run within a **Comlink Web Worker** for smooth, off-main-thread processing of complex geospatial operations like buffering, clipping, and union.
- **Responsive UI:** Lazy loading of heavy components, cooperative yielding during long tasks, and automatic worker fallbacks ensure a fluid user experience even with large datasets.
- **Flexible Layer & Basemap Management:** Toggle layer visibility, adjust opacity, and switch between normal, heatmap, and cluster styles, plus multiple configurable basemaps (OSM, Terrain, Satellite).
- **Geocoding & Search:** Integrated **Photon geocoder** with fly-to animations and marker drop.
- **Smooth Animations:** UI polished with **GSAP** for professional-grade, performant visual effects.

### Technologies Used:
- **Next.js** (React framework for scalable web apps)
- **TypeScript** (type-safe JavaScript)
- **MapLibre GL** (open-source interactive maps)
- **Turf.js** (geospatial analysis library)
- **Comlink** (simplifies web worker communication)
- **GSAP** (animation library)
- **Mapbox GL Draw** (drawing tools on maps)

## üìà Performance Notes

* Heavy UI panels are **lazy-loaded** via `next/dynamic`
* Web Worker for spatial ops when available
* Inline fallback with microtask yielding keeps UI responsive
* Debounced & abortable geocoding requests
* Shared geometry helpers for better tree-shaking

---

## üõ† Development Notes

* Code style: **ESLint + Prettier**
